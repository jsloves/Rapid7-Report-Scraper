

There were 2,004 vulnerabilities found during this scan. Of these, 678 were 
  critical vulnerabilities. Critical vulnerabilities require immediate 
  attention. They are relatively easy for attackers to exploit and may provide 
  them with full control of the affected systems. 560 vulnerabilities were 
  severe. Severe vulnerabilities are often harder to exploit and may not provide
  the same access to affected systems. There were 277 moderate vulnerabilities 
  discovered. These often provide information to attackers that may assist them 
  in mounting subsequent attacks on your network. These should also be fixed in 
  a timely manner, but are not as urgent as the other vulnerabilities. 

  Critical vulnerabilities were found to exist on 16 of the systems, making them
  most susceptible to attack. 67 systems were found to have severe 
  vulnerabilities. Moderate vulnerabilities were found on 80 systems. No 
  vulnerabilities were found on the remaining 42 systems.
